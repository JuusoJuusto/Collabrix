🚀 COLLABRIX v1.0.0 - NEXT STEPS

✅ COMPLETED:
- Removed all console logs from production code
- Fixed Firebase deprecation warnings
- Optimized server creation (instant UI updates)
- App maximizes on startup (fullscreen by default)
- Client built successfully

📋 TO DO NOW:

1. CLOSE THE DESKTOP APP
   - The desktop app MUST be closed before rebuilding
   - Close all Collabrix windows completely

2. REBUILD DESKTOP APP
   - Open terminal in: Discord alternative (Beta)/desktop
   - Run: npm run build:win
   - Wait for build to complete (creates new .exe)

3. DEPLOY CLIENT TO VERCEL
   - Client is already built (dist folder ready)
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Vercel will auto-deploy

4. TEST THE APP
   - Install the new desktop app
   - Create a server (should appear instantly)
   - Check that no console logs appear
   - Verify app is fullscreen on startup

🎯 WHAT'S FIXED:
- Server creation is now INSTANT (optimistic UI)
- No more deprecation warnings
- No console logs in production
- App maximizes on startup
- 30-second caching for faster loading
