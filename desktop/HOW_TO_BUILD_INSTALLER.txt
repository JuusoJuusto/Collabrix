HOW TO BUILD THE INSTALLER
==========================

EASIEST METHOD - Just double-click this file:
---------------------------------------------

>>> BUILD-INSTALLER-ADMIN.bat <<<

That's it! It will:
1. Ask for admin privileges (click Yes)
2. Clean old builds
3. Install dependencies
4. Build the installer
5. Show you where it is

The installer will be in: dist\Collabrix-Setup-1.0.0.exe


IF THAT DOESN'T WORK:
----------------------

The installer build requires admin privileges because electron-builder
downloads code signing tools that have symbolic links.

Windows needs admin rights to create symbolic links.

ALTERNATIVE: Use the portable version (already built!)
Location: dist\win-unpacked\Collabrix.exe

The portable version:
- Works perfectly
- No installation needed
- Can be copied anywhere
- Runs immediately

Just copy the "win-unpacked" folder and share it!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Q: BUILD-INSTALLER-ADMIN.bat doesn't ask for admin?
A: Right-click it and select "Run as administrator"

Q: Still getting symbolic link errors?
A: Use the portable version instead (dist\win-unpacked\Collabrix.exe)

Q: Want a real installer without admin hassles?
A: Use create-installer-from-portable.bat (requires NSIS)


SUMMARY:
--------

1. EASIEST: Double-click BUILD-INSTALLER-ADMIN.bat
2. ALTERNATIVE: Use portable version (already works!)
3. MANUAL: Right-click BUILD-INSTALLER-ADMIN.bat > Run as administrator

The portable version is already built and ready to use!
