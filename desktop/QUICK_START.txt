COLLABRIX DESKTOP - QUICK START
================================

GOOD NEWS: Your app is already built!
--------------------------------------

The portable version is ready in:
  dist\win-unpacked\Collabrix.exe

You can run it right now by double-clicking that file!


OPTION 1: USE PORTABLE VERSION (EASIEST)
-----------------------------------------

1. Go to: dist\win-unpacked\
2. Double-click: Collabrix.exe
3. The app will open!

To distribute:
  - Copy the entire "win-unpacked" folder
  - Share it with others
  - They just run Collabrix.exe


OPTION 2: CREATE INSTALLER (REQUIRES ADMIN)
--------------------------------------------

The installer build failed because Windows needs admin rights
to extract code signing tools.

To fix:
  1. Right-click: build-windows.bat
  2. Select: "Run as administrator"
  3. Click "Yes" on the UAC prompt
  4. Wait 2-3 minutes
  5. Installer will be in: dist\Collabrix-Setup-1.0.0.exe


WHY DID IT FAIL?
----------------

Error: "Cannot create symbolic link: A required privilege is not held"

This happens because:
- electron-builder downloads code signing tools
- These tools have symbolic links (Mac/Linux files)
- Windows needs admin rights to create symbolic links
- The portable build works fine without these tools


WHICH VERSION SHOULD I USE?
----------------------------

PORTABLE (Already built!):
  ✅ Works right now
  ✅ No admin needed
  ✅ Easy to distribute
  ✅ Can run from USB
  ❌ No Start Menu entry
  ❌ No desktop shortcut

INSTALLER (Needs admin):
  ✅ Professional installation
  ✅ Start Menu entry

  ❌ Requires admin to build
  ❌ Requires admin to install


RECOMMENDATION
--------------

Use the portable version! It's already built and works great.

Location: dist\win-unpacked\Collabrix.exe

Just run it and enjoy!
