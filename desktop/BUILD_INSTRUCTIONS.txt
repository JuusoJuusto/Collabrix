COLLABRIX DESKTOP APP - BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

STEP 1: ADD ICON FILES
-----------------------
You need TWO icon files in this folder:
- icon.ico (Windows icon)
- icon.png (PNG icon)

See CREATE_ICON.txt for how to create them.

STEP 2: CHOOSE BUILD TYPE
--------------------------

OPTION A - PORTABLE VERSION (RECOMMENDED - NO ADMIN NEEDED)
  1. Double-click: build-portable.bat
  2. Wait 2-3 minutes
  3. Find app in: dist\win-unpacked\Collabrix.exe
  4. Copy the whole "win-unpacked" folder anywhere
  5. Run Collabrix.exe - no installation needed!

OPTION B - INSTALLER VERSION (REQUIRES ADMIN)
  1. Right-click: build-windows.bat
  2. Select "Run as administrator"
  3. Wait 2-3 minutes
  4. Find installer in: dist\Collabrix-Setup-1.0.0.exe
  5. Run installer to install to Program Files

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

ERROR: "Cannot create symbolic link"
SOLUTION: Use build-portable.bat instead (no admin needed)

ERROR: "icon.ico not found"
SOLUTION: Add icon files first (see CREATE_ICON.txt)

ERROR: "electron-builder not found"
SOLUTION: Run "npm install" first

BUILD TAKES FOREVER
SOLUTION: First build takes 3-5 minutes (downloads dependencies)
          Later builds are faster (1-2 minutes)

WHICH VERSION SHOULD I USE?
----------------------------

PORTABLE:
  ✅ No admin rights needed
  ✅ Faster to build
  ✅ Can run from USB drive
  ✅ No installation needed
  ❌ No Start Menu entry
  ❌ No desktop shortcut

INSTALLER:
  ✅ Professional installation
  ✅ Start Menu entry
  ✅ Desktop shortcut
  ✅ Shows in Windows Apps
  ❌ Requires admin rights
  ❌ Slower to build

RECOMMENDATION: Start with portable version to test, then build installer for distribution.
